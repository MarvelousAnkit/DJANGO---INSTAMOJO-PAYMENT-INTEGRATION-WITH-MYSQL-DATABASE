# DJANGO---INSTAMOJO-PAYMENT-INTEGRATION-WITH-MYSQL-DATABASE
I created a website for the Patna Comedy Carnival Event where users can purchase tickets. All the data will be stored on the coffee table. If the payment is successful, then it will be reflected in the MySQL database. Due to some technical issue, payment is unsuccessful then it will be refunded within 24 hours.
